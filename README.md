## Overview
Our project explores how humans and an anthropomorphic​ robot, powered by a sophisticated Large Language Model​ (LLM), achieve alignment in conversations.

To measure the alignment, we will be running experiments of human-robot interactions with a [Furhat robot](https://furhatrobotics.com/). Asking the participants to complete a ranking tasks before and afterward to quantify the robot influence over the subject.

You'll find here the implementation of the Furhat client that will make the connection between the Furhat robot and the LLM API.
