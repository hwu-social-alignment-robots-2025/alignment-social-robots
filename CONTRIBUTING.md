# Contributing Guidelines
You'll find here some guidances on how to keep the codebase coherent.

## Conventional Commits
We encourage the use of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for your commit messages. This helps in maintaining a clean and organized commit history, making it easier to understand the changes made.

## Branches and Pull Requests
When working on new features, bug fixes, or any changes, please create a separate branch for each task. Naming branches descriptively helps in understanding the purpose of the branch.

Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request (PR) against the main branch. Provide a clear and concise description of the changes made in the PR description. This facilitates the review process.

It would be ideal if all substantial changes are reviewed by at least one other peer.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter any bugs, have suggestions, or want to discuss improvements, feel free to open an issue. Provide detailed information, including steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant context.
